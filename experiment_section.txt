D I - check plot 

D I - lin gaus reg

D I - full training run (possibly run again to get nice prediction results) - with gaus fac and non fac (possibly run again to get nice prediction results, but after i have results for everything else)

R I - model results per std with non bayesian - re calculate accuracy as in full training run

R -  stat table with gaus fac and non fac

D - full training run with e and t

R I - calibration 

R I - curroption

R i - curroption for one image

D I - continual learning

R - stat table for all



prn50_e and prn50_t running
 
when done:
	run all criteria on rn50 and prn50
when done, update:
 			1) tables 
			2) calibration, 
			3) full run for e and t,
			 4) the two corruption plots
