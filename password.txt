divide up data set:

figure out which metrics to track while training
	nll
	correct rate
	grad var

look at which models are used and which data it is used on
	dense net - MNIST
	dense net - FashionMNIST
	resnet18 - ImageNet
	resnet152 - ImageNet
	resnet18 - CIFAR10
	resnet152 - CIFAR10
	preresnet162 - CIFAR10



Set up training for two different batch sizes and two VI sample sizes (128 / 512), (10 / 50)
on frac radial, non frac radial, MFG
