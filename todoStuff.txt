- get nice plots of N R tR expR for MNIST and FashionMnost for nll and fail-rate
	--> we are getting wired results for FashionMnost, and it seem that fail-rate is t´not working
	--> They are running now check results once they are done 

- get nice calibration results (possibly try bayesian ECE)

- get 2d regression to work ie: get it to run on cluster (and maybe try it in a VCL setting)

- get nice plots of ER anc WER for MNIST and FashionMnost for nll and fail-rate

- make sure I did cvl correctly - have a look at the litereture to see how multiheaded cvl works 


- try out inference where the posterior is known to be Gaussian ie: a lin reg set up

	1)	do a 2d setup first so that the posterior can be plottet and you can check variance 
		to see if it is about the same as the analytical posterior
	2)	take it to higher dimensions to check if Radial out performs MFG 
		eventhough the analytical posterior is in Q_MFG

- try out (t + n) radial
